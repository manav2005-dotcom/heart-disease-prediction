# heart-disease-prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The goal is to develop a predictive system that can assist in early diagnosis by analyzing patient health data.

The dataset includes various medical attributes such as age, gender, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, maximum heart rate, and more. The project involved extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature selection to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling.

Multiple classification algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, with scikit-learn as the core ML library. Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to assess performance.

Key highlights of the project:

End-to-end pipeline: data preprocessing → model training → evaluation

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Visualizations for feature importance and model performance

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the healthcare domain and shows how predictive models can support medical decision-making.
